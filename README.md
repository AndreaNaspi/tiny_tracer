# tiny_tracer

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/hasherezade/tiny_tracer.svg)](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/releases)

A Pin Tool for tracing:
+ API calls, including [parameters of selected functions](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/wiki/Tracing-parameters-of-functions)
+ selected instructions: [RDTSC](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_278.html), [CPUID](https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_45.html)
+ transition between sections of the traced module (helpful in finding OEP of the packed module)

Bypasses the anti-tracing check based on RDTSC.

Generates a report in a `.tag` format (which can be [loaded into other analysis tools](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/wiki/Using-the-TAGs-with-disassemblers-and-debuggers)):
```

How to build?
-
ðŸš§ To compile the prepared project you need to use [Visual Studio >= 2012](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). It was tested with [Intel Pin 3.19 and 3.20](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads).<br/>
Clone this repo into `\source\tools` that is inside your Pin root directory. Open the project in Visual Studio and build. Detailed description available [here](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/wiki/Installation).

ðŸ“– More details about the usage you will find on [the project's Wiki](https://github.com/hasherezade/tiny_tracer/wiki).<br/>

WARNINGS
-
+ In order for Pin to work correctly, Kernel Debugging must be **DISABLED**.
+ In `install32_64` you can find a utility that checks if Kernel Debugger is disabled (`kdb_check.exe`), and it is used by the Tiny Tracer's `.bat` scripts. This utilty sometimes gets flagged as a malware by Windows Defender (it is a known false positive). If you encounter this issue, you may need to [exclude](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) the installation directory from Windows Defender scans.
+ Since the version 3.20 Pin has dropped a support for **old versions of Windows**. If you need to use the tool on Windows < 8, try to compile it with Pin 3.19.
